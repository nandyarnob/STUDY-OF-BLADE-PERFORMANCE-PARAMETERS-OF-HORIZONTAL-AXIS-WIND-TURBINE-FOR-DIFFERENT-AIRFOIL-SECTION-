# STUDY-OF-BLADE-PERFORMANCE-PARAMETERS-OF-HORIZONTAL-AXIS-WIND-TURBINE-FOR-DIFFERENT-AIRFOIL-SECTION

In this thesis, we investigated the variation of various parameter such as power coefficient, axial induction factor and angular induction factor for 7 different airfoil shapes. Characteristics of these airfoils (such as coefficient of drag and lift) were used in a numerical approach using the Blade Element Momentum (BEM) theory to find the induction factors as well as the power coefficient for a small scale wind turbine.

The program used for calculating the blade perfomance parameters is available in this respiratory.
